# Milk Distribution Optimization in NSW

## Overview  
This project was developed as part of an **individual academic project** in *QBUS2310 Management Science* at the University of Sydney. The task was to advise the NSW state government on where to build up to three new **milk distribution centers**.  

The model applies **Mixed Integer Programming (MIP)** in Python with Gurobi to minimize costs and delivery time, while accounting for demand, capacity, and demographic trends.  

The work showcases how **optimization can guide government policy and logistics planning**, particularly for perishable goods like milk.

## Objectives  
1. **Minimize distribution costs**  
   - Cost of transporting milk between LGAs based on distance and demand  
   - Cost of establishing new centers (capacity-dependent)  
   - Cost of purchasing tanker trucks  

2. **Ensure fairness & feasibility**  
   - No center >50% of state demand  
   - Maximum of 3 distribution centers  

3. **Extend the model**  
   - Sensitivity analysis for 10% annual population growth  
   - Impact of inflation (55.6% between 2001â€“2021)  
   - Multi-objective optimization (cost vs. delivery time)  
   - Tanker allocation and spoilage risk
